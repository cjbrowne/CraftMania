Factory Builder 3D
==========

A game of building factories!  It's a voxelised Factorio clone.

The game is based on an earlier project to clone Minecraft, called CraftMania.

Texture Pack
------------

Currently, we're using the same CraftMania texture pack, but we are also developing our own.

I'm using the awesome <strong><a href="http://www.carrotcakestudios.co.uk/gmcraft/">Good Morning Craft!</a></strong> texture pack by Louis Durrant (Carrot Cake Studios).
Of course, this is a texture pack developed for Minecraft by Mojang. So, you might try his texture pack for Minecraft. Make sure you take a look at it!
